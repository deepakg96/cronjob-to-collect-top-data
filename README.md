# What is this?
This is an example of how you can run some linux utilities to collect data and then periodically rollover collected logs.

# Prerequisites:
	Must have logrotate installed.
	Must have cron installed.
	(Both of these utilities are usually already packaged in standard linux distributions. If not, installing it should not be hard.)

# Limitations:
	NILL

# TODO:
	Add a few more failure conditions/checks.
